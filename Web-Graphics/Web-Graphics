	<h2> GIF vs. JPEG vs. PNG </h2>
	<h4> By Brandon Lay </h4>
	<p> By looking at the various web graphics saved we can quite cleary see the advantages and disadvantegs of saving as a .GIF, .JPEG, and .PNG. To start, the transparency difference in PNG-8 vs. PNG-24 is blaring. When comparing .PNG to .GIF it is also clear that their transparency settings are different. The edges appear to be rough and pixelated for both PNG's but the when saved as a GIF the graphics are really crisp. Laslty, when looking at the various .JPEG outputs, the high quality and maximium file sizes are much more clear and detailed than the lower quality outputs. </p>
