  	<p>Willard Mitt Romney (born March 12, 1947) is an American businessman who was the Republican Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 election. Before his presidential bid, he served as the 70th Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.</p>
    <p>Elected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002, Romney helped develop and enact into law the Massachusetts health care reform legislation, the first of its kind in the nation, which provided near-universal health insurance access through state-level subsidies and individual mandates to purchase insurance. He also presided over the elimination of a projected $1.2–1.5 billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and the closure of corporate tax loopholes. Romney did not seek re-election in 2006, instead focusing on his campaign for the Republican nomination in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. He won several primaries and caucuses but lost out to the eventual nominee, Senator John McCain. His considerable net worth, estimated in 2012 at $190–250 million, helped finance his political campaigns prior to 2012.</p>
	 <p>Romney won the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, thereby becoming the first Mormon to be a major party presidential nominee. He was defeated by incumbent Democratic <a href="Barack-Obama.html">President Barack Obama</a> in the <a href="../index.html">November 2012 general election</a>, losing by a 332–206 electoral college margin and by 51–47 percent in the popular vote.</p>
