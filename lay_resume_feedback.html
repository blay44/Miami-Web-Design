	  <!-- It wouldn't be awful if you put this in an address tag (since 
	       you asked :) ). Don't worry about how it looks. It is an
	       address, right? That's what is important. You can always
	       change the look using CSS.

	       Also, something to consider with the pipes separating each 
	       part of your contact information. What if you wanted to change
	       those in the future?

	       There are ways in CSS to change the content before and after 
	       tagged content. So, for instance, if you enclosed, say, each
	       piece of information in a span, you could change the pipe to
	       something else.

	       This is fine. Just something for you to think about. :)

	       Some people have linked their address. The traditional 
	       mailto: could lead to your email being harvested by spammers
	       if you want to link your email, I am allowing students 
	       to use an email encoder that protects their addresses.

	  <!-- A couple thoughts here.

	       1. You want to wrap your navigation in a nav tag.

	       2. Rather than list each item with br tags, why not use a
	       list? Again, if it's because you don't like the way it 
	       looks, you can change that with styling.

	  <!-- Another student had this issue and it actually has me thinking
	       of tinkering in some old browsers to see how it responds.

	       HTML5 does ask for id as opposed to name. So what you have
	       here is good, as long as the link works.

	       This is one of those gray areas that you debate whether its
	       better to have <a name="work"></a> or just add the id to an
	       element.

	       As I told another student, I really have to dig for an answer
	       on this, but good thinking outside of the box.

	   <!-- No need to use 'u'. Actually, I think it has been deprecated
	        from HTML5. You only need h2.

	        If you wanted to add a text decoration like an underline, you
	        will be able to do that with CSS. But using an underline for 
	        something that is not a link is generally a bad idea since
	        users associate underlines with links. You might have a person
	        click on your headline and wonder what's broken.

	        I saw this elsewhere, so you'll want to make sure its removed
	        in other parts of the document, too.
